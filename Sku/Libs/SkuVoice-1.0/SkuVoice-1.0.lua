-- [v43.2] The pump's two holds, named so they sit in ONE place and can be read
-- back by /skudebug tts.
--
-- WHY A HOLD EXISTS AT ALL -- the thing that is easy to get backwards: it does
-- NOT keep utterances apart. Separation comes from the client, which is handed
-- each line with `overlap` false and speaks them in order. Remove the holds and
-- speech does not merge into one blob; what breaks is the opposite.
--
-- A screen reader's own API takes the interrupt as part of the speak call --
-- Speak(text, interrupt) -- so replacing what is playing is ONE atomic
-- operation and needs no pacing anywhere. C_VoiceChat has no such parameter:
-- SpeakText(voiceID, text, rate, volume [, overlap]) cannot cancel, and
-- StopSpeakingText is a separate ASYNCHRONOUS call with no completion signal.
-- So Sku has to emulate one atomic operation with two racing ones, and
-- tBttsPostStopHold is the gap that stops the stop from landing on -- and
-- killing -- the very line it was issued to make room for. That race is real
-- and measured: see the comment at the queuereset branch below.
--
-- tBttsPostSpeakHold is the weaker of the two. It only ever delays a LONE queued
-- line (the `#queue > 1` bypass skips it otherwise) and its one real effect is
-- coalescing: while a line waits, a newer overwrite can prune it before it is
-- ever spoken. Inherited from the audio-file pump, where the same cadence has a
-- genuine clip-sequencing job that does not apply here.
--
-- ★MEASURED 2026-08-29, and 0.1 STAYS. Both numbers were inherited from the
-- audio-file pump and had never been checked, so they were measured properly
-- (gap histogram, see tAuditGap): one session run at `/skudebug tts hold 0 0`,
-- 233 handovers, 191 of them following a stop. Result:
--
--   0-9 ms:    2 samples, 0 lost
--   10-19 ms: 85 samples, 1 LOST      <- the async-stop race, exactly here
--   20-29 ms: 93 samples, 0 lost
--   30-39 ms:  7 samples, 0 lost
--   40-49 ms:  3 samples, 0 lost
--
-- Three things came out of that, all worth keeping written down:
--
-- 1. Setting the hold to 0 does NOT produce a 0 ms gap -- it produces ~10-30 ms
--    (93% of samples). The real floor is the pump's own `fTimeBTTS > 0.01` gate
--    plus the fact that a queuereset and its text are handled in SEPARATE pump
--    passes. The hold is not what creates the gap; it only widens it.
-- 2. So removing the hold saves ~80 ms per interrupted announcement, not 100.
--    Play-tested at 0: the reporter could not tell the difference. 80 ms of
--    speech-onset latency is below the perceptual threshold here, with the
--    bridge's own startup on top of it.
-- 3. The price of those 80 ms is the one loss above -- 1 in 233 handovers, where
--    two sessions at 0.1 s lost 0 in 358. For a screen-reader user a silently
--    dropped announcement is far worse than latency nobody can feel.
--
-- Hence: keep 0.1. Not because it was inherited, but because an imperceptible
-- gain is not worth a rare silent loss. Do not reopen without new evidence --
-- `/skudebug tts` reproduces the measurement.

-- NVDA on that mark and then forwards the text -- Prism's speak(text,

-- [v43.2] Typing-echo fast lane.
--
-- A typed character has the opposite requirements to an announcement: it must be
-- audible NOW, it is one character long, and pressing the same key twice is the
-- user saying something, never a redundant repeat. Routing it through the normal
-- queue cost it ~0.2s (batching + post-stop hold, serialized) and fed it to a
-- dedup guard that swallowed every doubled letter.
--
-- So it gets its own lane, drained by the same OnUpdate:
--   * no queuereset, so consecutive characters never stop each other. The stop
--     is issued ONCE, when typing starts and something else is still audible;
--   * never writes tLastHandedText, so the duplicate guard cannot see it.
--
-- [v43.5] It is a QUEUE with ONE utterance outstanding -- NOT the single
-- overwriting slot it was in v43.2/v43.4. Why, measured from a user capture on a
-- real SAPI voice (Era, v43.4, reported as "TTS speaks random half sentences of
-- closed stuff while I am in other menus"):
--
--   The client accepts every SpeakText without limit and plays them one at a
--   time, and C_VoiceChat.StopSpeakingText() cancels only the utterance that is
--   PLAYING -- it is NOT SAPI's PurgeBeforeSpeak. Anything already accepted can
--   never be taken back. The old slot released a character on the NEXT FRAME, so
--   typing at 3-4 chars/s handed the client 3-4 utterances a second while it
--   could finish about one. Captured bursts of 104, 102 and 67 characters parked
--   ~80 utterances INSIDE the client; they then started one per second for the
--   next 50+ seconds, long after the chat box had closed, interleaved with menu
--   announcements. The utterance ids prove it: ids handed at 15:20:17 STARTED at
--   15:20:22, :28 and :30 -- after later ids had already come and gone -- and six
--   StopSpeakingText calls in between removed none of them.
--
--   That is also why CancelBttsOutput and EndScope looked broken. They delete
--   mSkuVoiceQueueBTTS correctly, but the characters were never in it: the old
--   slot handed them straight over. 85 of 93 EndScope calls in that capture
--   logged dropped=0, and the hard cancel on the send keypress removed 1 of ~28.
--   The cleanup was always right; the HANDOVER POLICY defeated it.
--
-- This is NVDA's structure (checked against nvaccess/nvda, 2026-09-18):
-- speakTypedCharacters -> speakSpelling at Spri.NORMAL with NO cancel in that
-- path, so every letter is spoken and nothing is overwritten; speech/manager.py
-- hands the synth driver exactly ONE utterance at a time and waits for its
-- index/done callback; and because the backlog stays in NVDA's OWN queue,
-- cancelSpeech can still throw it away (the SAPI5 driver's cancel is
-- Speak(None, Async | PurgeBeforeSpeak) -- a real purge, which WoW does not give
-- us). Hold the queue yourself, feed one at a time, keep the power to discard.
-- ★Do NOT "simplify" this back to newest-wins: dropping letters was proposed and
-- rejected, because NVDA speaks every letter even at fast typing and so must Sku.

-- [v43.7] The client gate -- ONE rule for every utterance and every stop.
--
-- The rule, learned five times over in v43.5..e for the typing lane and then
-- found again in a field capture for everything else: ★the client holds at most
-- ONE utterance of ours, and a stop aimed at an utterance that has not STARTED
-- is delivered when it starts.
--
-- Why. The client accepts every SpeakText without limit, StopSpeakingText
-- cancels only the utterance that is PLAYING, and after a stop the NEWEST
-- submission starts at once while older unstarted ones stay parked until the
-- engine next goes idle by itself. So an utterance handed over while another
-- one is still in the client can never be taken back, and it surfaces seconds
-- or minutes later, out of order. Capture (Anniversary, real SAPI voice, v43.5
-- release, 32 minutes): 24 of 524 handovers started 3-71 s late. Filter letters
-- "g r", "g r e i f" spoke 5 s after "menue geschlossen"; five guild chat lines
-- arrived 65-71 s late; Sku's own audit called them all SUPERSEDED. Two
-- producers, one mechanism:
--   * an overwrite line: its stop was issued before the PREVIOUS handover had
--     started, missed it, that one then started, and the new line was handed
--     over behind a live utterance -> parked;
--   * a line without a stop in front (chat): handed over while something plays
--     -> parked, and every later keypress jumps ahead of it.
--
-- So the policy moves to the ONE place every utterance passes (BttsHandOver
-- arms the gate) and the ONE place every stop passes (BttsStop). Nothing about
-- WHO may cancel WHOM changes: queuereset, scopes, the echo purge, the dup
-- guards and neverResetQueues decide exactly as before. The gate only decides
-- WHEN a decision already taken reaches the client -- a waiting line sits in
-- Sku's own queue, where those rules can still see it, instead of in the
-- client's, where nothing can.
--
-- On the NVDA bridge STARTED and FINISHED arrive in the handover frame, so the
-- gate is open again before the pump's next pass and nothing here is ever
-- waited on: that path behaves exactly as before. This is real-SAPI-path only.
--
-- This REPLACES the v43.5c kill window ("block handovers for 0.3 s after a hard
-- cancel and stop whatever starts"). That was this same idea with a guessed
-- time span and wired to two of the five stop sites; the deferred stop below is
-- the exact version of it and covers all of them.
--
-- How long an utterance may sit handed-over without a STARTED before the gate
-- gives up on it (the async-stop race really killed it, or the event is
-- missing). Same figure as the `lost` audit, measured there: 0 of 358 stopped
-- handovers took longer at the shipped hold.
local tClientGateStartTtl = 0.5
-- ★Escape hatch: nothing that can delay ALL speech may depend on events
-- arriving. After this many handovers in a row without any STARTED the gate
-- stands down completely until a STARTED is seen again: everything is handed
-- over at once and stopped at once. A wedged client TTS pipeline looks like
-- this; real voices are silent then whatever Sku does, but on the bridge the
-- text still reaches NVDA, and waiting out a 1 s TTL per typed character there
-- is what "the keyboard echo is very slow" was.

-- [v43.7] Speech that is NOT ours: another addon's SpeakText, Blizzard's own chat
-- TTS, a /run. The gate above only knows Sku's handovers, so a foreign utterance
-- broke the one-in-the-client rule from outside. Capture (Anniversary, real SAPI):
-- a /run utterance parked as id 403, started 11 s later under the first typed
-- character; [r] was handed over behind it, got no STARTED, the 0.5 s start TTL
-- gave up on it, [e] went in as well, [e] took [r]'s STARTED for its own -- and
-- the [l] after them spoke behind "abgebrochen", past every cancel.
-- Two rules:
--   * a STARTED nobody is waiting for, or one whose id is OLDER than anything
--     seen before our handover, is foreign. It is never taken for our id;
--   * while it plays nothing of ours is handed over: the line waits in Sku's own
--     queue, where a cancel still reaches it. One of OUR stops ends it (it kills
--     whatever plays), so an announcement that carries a stop never waits.
-- at = last event seen for it. A foreign utterance stopped by its owner reports
-- nothing more, so this measures SILENCE and gives up after tForeignSilenceMax.

-- 2026-09-21), and the same dead air between the parts of a quest text or two
-- chat lines. Handing the next utterance over earlier buys nothing (v43.5e: it
-- only parks). What DOES free the engine at once is a stop -- fast arrowing
-- starts four lines a second. So when the audio of ours is over and something
-- is WAITING, stop the silent tail and hand over after the usual post-stop gap.
--   * only after "Start" AND then "End" for our id: this client sometimes sends
--     End BEFORE Start (first utterance after a stop), and that one proves nothing;

-- BTTS cache-buster (WoW 12.0 engine): the new client caches synthesized audio

-- screen-reader bridge (NVDA/SAPI2SR) the cached audio is silent AND the bridge
-- is never called, so already-spoken lines go silent on revisit. Appending a
-- cycling run of an invisible character makes each utterance's text unique ->
-- every SpeakText is a cache MISS -> the voice is always invoked. Only applied
-- to the Blizzard-TTS (SpeakText) path. See the body for WHICH character, and
-- why a cycling <bookmark> is NOT enough.
-- [v43.3] The run length is counted PER TEXT, not globally. It used to be one
-- session-wide counter cycling 1..64, which meant any line repeated exactly 64
-- handovers after itself went out byte-identical and hit the cache again. That
-- is not a corner case: measured over a 50-minute capture, 27 of 1307 handovers
-- collided that way -- "menue geschlossen", "annehmen", "buffs" and single typed
-- characters among them, i.e. exactly the short lines a user revisits all
-- evening. Keyed by text, a line only reuses a variant after MAX repeats OF
-- ITSELF; in that same capture the most-repeated string occurred 36 times and
-- NOTHING collided.
-- [v43.5] Two more things, both from one capture (2026-09-12, "nagakampf-
-- handschuhe" silent for six presses in a row while every neighbour spoke, and
-- Sku logged a clean SpeakText + STARTED + FINISHED for each):
--  1) ★The counters must OUTLIVE a /reload. The client's audio cache lives in
--     the engine, not in Lua -- utterance IDs run straight across a reload,
--     and that line had last been rendered more than 44 minutes earlier. A
--     reload used to reset this table, so a text seen again afterwards was
--     re-seeded at the global rotation point and could land back INSIDE the
--     run range it had already used before the reload; every press then
--     replayed a cached (silent) variant until the counter walked out of that
--     range. So the table and the seed now live in the host's SavedVariables
--     (SkuVoice:SetCacheBustStore, called by SkuOptions once its DB is up) and
--     a reload continues the count. A client restart continues it too, which
--     is harmless: the cache is fresh then and the count merely runs on.
--  2) The per-text space is 512 variants instead of 64: the trailing run still
--     cycles 1..64, and every 64th wrap adds one more LEADING no-break space
--     (1..8). The single leading one was already there and inaudible; a few
--     more in the same place are the same character in the same place. A text

	--    [v43.2] The cycling <bookmark mark="skcN"/> that used to do this job does

	--    bookmark (skc9, skc11, skc13 ... not one repeat), and the hit still went
	--    silent after a few passes while Sku kept getting a clean SpeakText +
	--    STARTED + FINISHED for each press. The client parses the markup off and
	--    keys its audio cache on the SPOKEN text, so a varying bookmark is
	--    invisible to it. The ORIGINAL buster (a cycling run of zero-width
	--    characters) varied real character data and therefore worked; swapping it
	--    for a bookmark to protect NVDA's prosody silently reintroduced the exact
	--    bug it had been written to fix.
	--
	--    So vary real character data again, but place it AFTER the last word where
	--    it cannot colour the prosody of anything: a run of 1..64 U+00A0, counted
	--    per text (see BTTS_CACHEBUST_MAX above; since v43.5 the LEADING run
	--    1..8 carries the high part of that count). Trailing
	--    whitespace is inaudible, and U+00A0 is not XML whitespace -- the very
	--    property point 1 already relies on -- so the client's XML normalization
	--    cannot trim it back off and collapse the variants into one cache key.
	--
	--    The bookmark stays: it costs nothing, the patched engine strips it, and it
	--    still busts the key on any client that DOES hash the raw string.
	--
	--    [v43.3] Except on macOS: that client's engine does not parse the markup
	--    off and speaks it literally ("bookmark skc..."), reported in PR #17. The

--
-- Why TrimBttsQueue was not enough for the typing echo. The pump dequeues
-- WITHOUT waiting for playback whenever more than one entry is pending
-- (`#mSkuVoiceQueueBTTS > 1` bypasses the 0.1 s pacing), so a burst of queued
-- lines is handed to C_VoiceChat.SpeakText within a few frames. From that
-- moment the backlog lives in the CLIENT's TTS queue, where Sku's own queue is
-- empty and TrimBttsQueue has nothing left to drop -- which is exactly why
-- typed characters kept being read out long after the edit box was gone.
-- Stopping playback is the only thing that reaches that backlog.
--
-- Deliberately ignores `neverResetQueues`: that setting keeps ROUTINE
-- announcements from cutting each other off. This is not routine output -- it

-- [v43.2] Speak ONE typed character (or a short key-feedback string) with the
-- lowest latency this API allows.
--
-- Why it does not go through OutputStringBTtts: an announcement and a keystroke
-- want opposite things. The queue path batches, paces, overwrites-by-stop and
-- dedups -- correct for a menu line, and four separate ways to swallow or delay a
-- letter. The measured cost was ~0.2s per character (a 0.1s producer-side batch
-- and the 0.1s post-stop hold, serialized), doubled letters eaten by the
-- back-to-back guard, and a StopSpeakingText per keystroke whose async landing
-- killed the NEXT letter.
--
-- What happens here instead:
--   * ONE slot. A character typed while the previous one is still waiting simply
--     replaces it, so a held key or a paste can never produce a burst of
--     utterances -- the coalescing the old 0.1s batch existed for, at frame
--     resolution instead.
--   * The stop is issued ONCE, on the first character of a burst, where it has
--     something real to interrupt (the field's own announce). Consecutive
--     characters never stop each other: the client sequences them itself, and a
--     stop between two letters can only cut the first or kill the second.
--   * tLastHandedText is never written, so the duplicate guard cannot see typed
--     characters at all. Pressing the same key twice is the user saying
--     something, never a redundant repeat.
