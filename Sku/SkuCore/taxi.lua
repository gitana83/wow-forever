-- SkuCore/taxi.lua - flightmaster taxi flights: track the route, announce the
-- next flight point you could land at, and request an early landing from a Sku
-- keybind.
--
-- FLIGHTMASTER ONLY - NOT VEHICLES
-- UnitOnTaxi("player") is the exact discriminator and is the same test the
-- Blizzard code uses to pick the taxi branch over VehicleExit():
--    if UnitOnTaxi("player") then TaxiRequestEarlyLanding() else VehicleExit() end
-- (Blizzard_ActionBar/Shared/PossessActionBar.lua and .../VehicleLeaveButton.lua)
-- Self-flying and flying vehicles keep player control and leave UnitOnTaxi
-- false. Every entry point re-checks it; we NEVER fall through to VehicleExit().
--
-- ============ WHAT THE LIVE FLIGHTS ESTABLISHED (2026-08-03/04) ==============
-- CONFIRMED WORKING in game: the announcement names the right flight point and
-- the keybind lands the player there instead of carrying on one stop further.
-- The road there disproved three plausible assumptions - written down so nobody
-- re-derives them:
--
-- 1. THE REQUEST ALWAYS LANDS YOU AT THE **NEXT** FLIGHT POINT. The client's own
--    TAXI_CANCEL_DESCRIPTION says so ("Laesst Euch am naechsten Flugpunkt
--    landen"), and TAXI_CANCEL is "Flug unterbrechen" - the early-landing UI
--    does ship for TBC. So the only correct answer to "where would I land" is
--    the next unpassed stop on the route, which is what the route cursor tracks.
--    An earlier reading of the evidence - "the server ignores the request" -
--    was WRONG: those calls went out at arbitrary moments and simply had nothing
--    useful to do.
--
-- 2. IsPossessBarVisible() LIES ON THIS CLIENT. It returned false for entire
--    flights while PossessButton2:IsShown() was true at the same moment. The
--    real on-screen affordance is MainMenuBarVehicleLeaveButton (leaveVisible),
--    and PossessButton2 has its shown flag set under a hidden parent - which is
--    why availability is read with IsVisible(), never IsShown(). That button is
--    visible for the WHOLE flight, so there is no "offer appears" window either;
--    announcements are driven by the route cursor and by proximity.
--
-- 3. NEAREST NODE IS THE WRONG QUESTION. Answering it produced Brackenwall - a
--    HORDE node, 1455 yards off, unusable by an Alliance player - because
--    C_TaxiMap.GetTaxiNodesForMap returns all ~40 continent nodes regardless of
--    faction or discovery. The route capture (hooksecurefunc("TakeTaxiNode"),
--    the one window in which GetNumRoutes/TaxiGetNodeSlot/TaxiNodeName still
--    work) supersedes it: every captured stop is by definition usable by this
--    character. Nearest-node survives only as a labelled fallback for a /reload
--    mid-flight, faction-filtered and proximity-gated.
--
-- ============ ANNOUNCEMENTS ARE OPTIONAL, THE FEATURE IS NOT ================
-- Einstellungen -> Allgemein -> "Flugpunkte zum Landen ansagen" (default ON,
-- SkuCore.taxiAnnounceLandingPoints) silences the two spoken lines for players
-- who find them chatty. Nothing else changes: the route is still captured and
-- tracked, /skutaxi still answers, and SKU_KEY_TAXICANCEL still requests the
-- landing AND still speaks its own confirmation - that one answers a key the
-- player just pressed, so it is not chatter. See tAnnounceEnabled.
--
-- LOGGING: everything under the "taxi:" prefix, gated behind /skudebug log on.
--   py -3 dev/rework-docs/_dbgtail.py 400 taxi:
-- `/skutaxi` dumps live state on demand.

-- the player walks: every node coming inside APPROACH_DIST would announce "early
-- landing possible" long after the flight ended. So regaining player control -
-- which cannot happen in the middle of a flightmaster flight - latches this and
-- nothing may speak or re-arm the watch until a new flight is actually taken.

-- the flight point I took off from" / "...the one I was flying to") describe the
-- nearest-node FALLBACK, which knows neither. TaxiGetNodeSlot(index, 1, true) is

-- applying. The destination was by then well inside APPROACH_DIST, so every
-- flight ended with "Vorzeitige Landung moeglich bei <destination>" a few
-- seconds before simply arriving there. The destination is not a stop you pass;
-- it is where the flight ends. Holding the cursor on it keeps tVia == "route"

-- /skucheck taxi - the tripwire for the fix above.

-- Invariant: an EARLY LANDING is never the flight's own start or end point.
-- Landing where you took off is not landing early, and landing at the
-- destination is just arriving - yet both were being announced (the reports this
-- shipped for), because the nearest-node fallback knows neither name.
--
-- Two parts, so the domain is never vacuous:
--   * a contract probe on the name comparison the guard is built out of - it
--     runs on the ground and pins the "Ratschet, Brachland" == "Ratschet" rule
--     that makes the guard fire at all;
--   * the live invariant, checked only while actually airborne.
