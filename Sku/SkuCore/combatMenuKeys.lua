-- SkuCore.combatMenuKeys  --  Path A, Stage 1: drive the Sku menu IN COMBAT via secure
-- override bindings bound at combat start, REPLACING the EnableKeyboard capture frame for
-- the nav keys.
--
-- Why this works (all verified in-game via the combatActionsProbe, 2026-07-01):
--   * Binding at combat start (PLAYER_REGEN_DISABLED) is reliable in this client -- there
--     is a grace window where InCombatLockdown() is still false, so SetOverrideBindingClick
--     succeeds (8/8 combats, lock=0 every time).
--   * A persistent secure binding's insecure PostClick can call the normal menu handler
--     in combat -- the exact same call the capture frame made -- so reading/nav/open/close
--     all work headlessly.
--   * The capture frame consumes keys before any binding fires, so the two CANNOT coexist
--     on the same keys -> when we bind here, the capture-enable points are skipped (gated
--     on Sku.combatSecureKeysBound).
--
-- SAFETY: if the grace window is ever missing (lock==1), or the feature is off, we do NOT
-- bind and leave Sku.combatSecureKeysBound false -> the callers keep the capture frame, so
-- in-combat READING never regresses. Toggle the whole approach with /skucombatsecure
-- (default ON) -- flip OFF to fall straight back to the capture frame.
--
-- Stage 1 is NAV ONLY (read/navigate/open/close). Actions (right-click/use) arrive in
-- Stage 2 via the bags/equipment mirror. First-letter is intentionally NOT here (binding
-- 26 letters would hijack ability keys). See [[sku42-combat-item-use-design]].

-- Stage 3: the nav keys are now user-configurable Sku keybinds (registered in
-- SkuOptions.skuDefaultKeyBindings, defaults = the old hardcoded arrows/home/end/backspace/
-- escape). Each row maps a keybind CONST to a fixed LOGICAL action: at combat start we look up
-- the physical key the user assigned and bind it as a secure override click whose "button"
-- string is the logical action -- so BOTH the secure snippet AND the insecure menu handler
-- keep seeing the same action name no matter which key drives it. Rebinding a key never
-- changes behaviour, only which key triggers it. ESCAPE (default) closes the combat menu;
-- while bound (whole combat) it loses its normal game function -- an accepted cost of the
-- dedicated-combat-keys model.
-- The two CLICK keys are intentionally NOT in this list -- they are bound separately in
-- CombatMenuKeysBindNow, and to different targets: the left key (SKU_KEY_MENULEFTCLICK) is
-- routed here as the logical action "ENTER" (its actions are insecure), the right key
-- (SKU_KEY_MENURIGHTCLICK) goes straight to the secure USE button, which fires the armed
-- /use. The old SKU_KEY_COMBATMENU_USE bind that put BOTH on the use button is retired.

-- READING keys (tooltip / reading-frame line navigation). Not user-configurable -- they are
-- hardcoded SHIFT-UP/-DOWN + CTRL-SHIFT-UP/-DOWN out of combat too, so they route straight
-- through as their own logical action.
--
-- WHY they must be bound here: out of combat these four are BASE-bound to OnSkuOptionsMain,
-- the OVERVIEW reader (SkuZOptions/Core.lua ~2333, set once at load and never cleared), and
-- are only re-pointed at the menu window by OnSkuOptionsMainOption1's OnShow (~3136). In
-- combat that OnShow never runs (the protected parent can't Show), SetOverrideBindingClick is
-- combat-locked, and the capture frame deliberately stands down whenever we bind here -- so
-- the keys fell through to the base binding and read the OVERVIEW PAGE instead of the focused
-- entry's tooltip, even with the combat menu open. The kroute handler below picks the target
-- exactly the way the two bindings do out of combat: menu open -> the menu window (tooltip),
-- menu closed -> OnSkuOptionsMain (overview), so in-combat overview reading is unchanged.
--
-- The reading-frame LINK keys (SHIFT-LEFT/-RIGHT/-ENTER/-BACKSPACE) and SHIFT-PAGEDOWN are
-- NOT here: those are already base-bound straight to OnSkuOptionsMainOption1 (Core.lua
-- ~2337-2351), so they never had the wrong-target problem.

--   * secure _onclick SNIPPET -> the bags MIRROR (Stage 2): tracks the cursor in lockstep
--     with the navigation (view level + all-items list index; items are LEAVES -- the old
--     Links/Rechtsklick sub-level was removed with the click rework), arms the secure use
--     button with "/use <bag> <slot>" for the focused item; the USE / right-click key
--     bound straight to that button FIRES it -- a real in-combat right-click.
--
-- The mirror is armed by HOME: press HOME while in the "alle Taschen" (all items) list to
-- SYNC -- it activates the mirror, aligns index 1 to the list's first item, and the
-- PostClick sends the menu to that same first item. From there arrows step both in
-- lockstep. LEFT out of the item list deactivates it (re-press HOME to re-sync). The
